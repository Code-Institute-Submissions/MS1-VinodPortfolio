#   UX

##  Strategy
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site while striving for a minimalist and user-friendly design.
##  Scope
For employers, I wanted to provide them with a brief overview of myself and my capabilities. This way, they would be able to get a glimpse of who I am, my background, work I've done, and my skills, with the option to contact me if they choose.
##  Structure
I wanted them to be able to quickly access work that I've done, providing a short summary of the project and main technologies with a link to each GitHub Repository and live demo. A link to my LinkedIn profile, my GitHub, and a downloadable PDF version of my CV were also provided for their ease of access.

##  Surface
The greyscale color scheme was chosen to create a sleek and modern feel.
##  Technologies
HTML

CSS

Bootstrap

## Features
This site uses the scrollSpy feature in Bootstrap for a 'smooth scrolling' effect. The navbar also stays collapsed regardless of the screen size to promote a minimalist design.

## Testing
The employer and recruiter user story achieved the intended outcome of providing them with a showcase of myself and my work. In the about me section, they can read a bit about my background, and if they're viewing on a desktop, the background of this section is a photo of me. They are able to see my showcased projects via the project cards in the "Work" section. They can view both the live version and the GitHub repository by clicking on the Font Awesome icons. They are also able to view my social media profiles via clicking on the icons in the footer. They are also able to download my CV by either clicking on CV in the navbar dropdown, or by clicking on the document icon in the footer.


##  Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting git clone https://github.com/vinod2rahul/MS1-VinodPortfolio into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type git remote rm origin into the terminal.
