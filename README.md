##  Strategy
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site while striving for a minimalist and user-friendly design.
##  Scope
For employers, I wanted to provide them with a brief overview of myself and my capabilities. This way, they would be able to get a glimpse of who I am, my background, work I've done, and my skills, with the option to contact me if they choose.
##  Structure
In the 'Work/Travail' section, I wanted them to be able to quickly access work that I've done, providing a short summary of the project and main technologies with a link to each GitHub Repository and live demo. A link to my LinkedIn profile, my GitHub, and a downloadable PDF version of my CV were also provided for their ease of access.
